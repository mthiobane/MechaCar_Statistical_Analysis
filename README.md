## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
We can see that the vehicle length (2.60e-12), and vehicle ground (5.21e-08). In other words, the vehicle length and vehicle ground have a significant impact on miles per gallon. 

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model considered cannot consider to be zero because the intercept is statistically non-significant -1.040e+02.
When an intercept is statistically significant, it means that the intercept term explains a significant amount of variability in the dependent variable when all independent variables are equal to zero.
This is not our case.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
We can say that this linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the r-squared value is around 0.7149. this mean that 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model.
